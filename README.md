# Twitter-Bot

Twitter bot that posts random quotes. Used google sheets as the database to store different quotes, and leveraged both the google sheets API and tweepy API. Added error handling to ensure that there were no duplicate quotes posted. Used Python's built in scheduler function to post quotes to twitter within a specific timeframe. Built using Python. 

Still in the early process of learning how to encrypt API keys. Google sheets API credentials and Tweepy API credentials are not shown.
